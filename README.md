# Lamini-Summariize

Into the world of Generative AI and create a powerful PDF summarization app using the cutting-edge language model, LaMini-LM. With the help of Streamlit, a user-friendly Python library, we'll build an intuitive web interface that allows you to effortlessly summarize PDF documents with just a few clicks.

To streamline the heavy lifting of preprocessing and language model integration, we'll leverage Langchain, a versatile toolkit explicitly designed for Language model-based tasks. Throughout this video, I'll guide you through setting up the environment, installing the necessary dependencies, and integrating LaMini-LM and Streamlit into your project. You'll learn how to handle PDF files, extract relevant text data, and feed it into the language model for summarization.
